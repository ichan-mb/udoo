        <p>This module helps automatically captures and displays events by recording what activity was performed, who
            performed it, and when it occurred.<br>
            With this information, you can ensure that you're able to follow up and address any unexpected or
            undesirable events.
        </p>
        <p><b style="color: #0e616e;">Highlights</b></p>
        There are several kinds of events that are logged:
        <p><b><small>⤳ Admin Activity</small></b><br>
        <p><b><small>⤳ Data Access</small></b><br>
        <p>To access the audit logs, on the homepage, go to Admin Settings > Technical > Audit > Logs. Within this tab, you
            can see a list of events that have been tracked under your Odoo's account.
